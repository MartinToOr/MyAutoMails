# MyAutoMails

Simple web app for scheduling OpenAI-powered scripts and emailing the results.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies with `npm install` (requires internet access).
2. Create a PostgreSQL database and run `schema.sql` to create the tables. This
   includes `test_runs` (used to limit daily prompt tests) and `email_history`
   for storing previous emails.
3. Configure environment variables for the database (set `DB_URL`), SMTP and OpenAI API keys.
4. Start the server with `npm start`.

Users can register via `/register.html`; passwords are hashed with bcrypt before being stored. Login is available at `/index.html`.

The scheduler checks every five minutes. If a script's `next_execution` time falls within two minutes of the current time, it triggers a request to OpenAI and mails the response to the specified recipients.

Script times must be set using minutes in five minute increments (00, 05, 10, ... 55).
The client sends its timezone offset so scheduled times are normalized to the server's UTC clock.

A collapsible sidebar can be toggled using the menu button (â˜°) on pages after logging in.
